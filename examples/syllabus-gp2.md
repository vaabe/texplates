# In-Person vs Remote

You choose at the beginning of the semester whether you're going to take this course in-person or remotely. The department's policy is that you should stick to your choice throughout the semester (to the extent that you can; obviously we'll make reasonable exceptions due to covid). 

# In-Person Labs

If you're taking the course in-person, you will perform the experiments individually. You should read the manual before coming to class so you know what to expect. [At the very least you should skim over the theory. E&M is non-trivial and it'll be easier if you actually understand what you're observing]. 

# Remote Labs 

Each week we'll post the relevant lab materials (data, videos, simulations, etc) in the [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1onTfWs8QGWsOP_3PFigj7CvMpJUr_Kn4?usp=sharing). You should base your report on the data we provide. There will be two or three zoom office hours each week. These meetings aren't mandatory but I encourage you to show up and ask questions. Asides from that you'll be working fairly independently, and  it's your responsibility to manage your time and keep up with the schedule.  

# Assignments

Each week you will write a report on the experiment you performed that week. I will mark your submission out of 10:  

- **Theory: /2**
- **Experiment Setup: /2**
- **Results: /6** (split into three subsections)
	+ **Presentation of data: /2**
	+ **Analysis of results, discussion questions: /2**
	+ **Sources of error: /2**

I've also posted a guide with more detailed advice on writing reports. Give it a read if you're stumped for ideas. 

# Deadlines

Reports are due at the beginning of the next scheduled session (i.e. Thursdays). Please be reasonable.  

# Resubmission

Throughout the semester I'll allow you to resubmit two reports for a better grade. Email me.
