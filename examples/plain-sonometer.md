# Sonometer Lab Instructions

`mdpdf plain-sonometer.md`

The point of the lab is to demonstrate how the normal mode frequency of a string depends on length, tension, and mass density. Read through the manual. You'll see there are four experiments in this lab:

1. Mode frequency versus $n$
2. First mode frequency versus length $L$
3. First mode frequency versus tension $T$
4. Mode frequencies and mass density $\mu$

The experiments have been done for you by a member of the physics faculty. Your task is to write a lab report based on their data, which we've provided for you in the data folder. I've also posted an interactive version of the data on Airtable, which you may find is easier to work with---follow the link:

If you're stuck on how to write the report, read over the report writing guidelines I've posted. It's not a rulebook, but it outlines some of the basic components your report should probably have. 

Report 1 is due on Thursday February 25th (not the 18th as stated earlier). If you have questions please let me know.
