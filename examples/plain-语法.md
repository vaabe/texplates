## sentence structure

* chinese is SVO, with some notable exceptions [just as in english]

* __topicalisation:__ whereby you start a sentence with the topic ("given" or "old" information) and end with the comment ("new" information) 
	+ in this structure a DO or IDO can be moved to the front of the sentence
	+ 中国菜怎么做？ -> Zhōngguó cài zěnme zuò? -> [chinese food] how make -> how do you cook chinese food?

* __ergative structure/locative inversion:__ where S is moved to O position and the empty S position is filled with a locative expression
	+ "XVS" structure, where X is a locative expression

## copula 

* 是 -> to be / is
